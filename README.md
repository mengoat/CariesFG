# CariesFG
This is the official code for CariesFG: A Fine-Grained RGB Image Classification Framework with Attention Mechanism for Dental Caries.
Due to patient privacy concerns, we are unable to provide unrestricted access to our clinical data. However, we have made available samples of the data for interested researchers to conduct code debugging and testing. Going forward, we will explore options for creating a public dataset to advance the development of this field while ensuring patient privacy is protected.
